We review the growth of API\\r\\neconomy and how organizations have been realizing the potential of open APIs in\\r\\ntransforming their business.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Kaushik Pal , TechAlpine. comments\\r\\nThe already huge world of big data and analytics has got a boost in the form of\\r\\nopen Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The use of open APIs has been\\r\\ngenerating huge volumes of big data. Since open APIs are now accessed by the\\r\\ngeneral public, mainly via apps and software programs, it has resulted into an\\r\\nexponential growth of data. Open APIs are also contributing to the creation of\\r\\nanalytics because a group of APIs now have cognitive abilities which enable them\\r\\nto deliver analytics to systems. The growth of open APIs and other APIs has\\r\\ngiven birth to the term “ API economy ”. Prominent business houses such as Google and Yahoo have been offering public\\r\\nAPIs for different purposes such as weather updates and traffic management.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is an open API?\\r\\n\\r\\nAn open API is made available in the Internet and is available for use free of\\r\\ncost. For example, a startup software company specialized in the insurance\\r\\ndomain may make its underwriting calculation software available as an open API.\\r\\nInterested third-party developers may access the calculation software as per the\\r\\nterms and conditions of the API availability. The third-party developers may use\\r\\nthe calculator in any manner unless they are bound by specific terms and\\r\\nconditions of API usage. Usually, open APIs are not bound by any terms and\\r\\nconditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen API provides benefits to both the owner and the user of it. For the owner,\\r\\nwhenever the open API is used, it means its products and services are getting\\r\\npublicity while it retains the ownership of the code. For the user, open APIs\\r\\nrelieve the third-party developers of the effort required to build an entire\\r\\nsoftware program from the scratch. The software the third-party developers are\\r\\nbuilding is a mashup between the source software and new code.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is are some sites that list many public APIs\\r\\n\\r\\n * Any-API, Documentation and Test Consoles for Over 225 Public APIs\\r\\n * ProgrammableWeb API Directory, search over 15,000 APIs\\r\\n * Wikipedia list of open APIs\\r\\n * NASA open APIs\\r\\n * Data.gov APIs\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is an API economy?\\r\\n\\r\\nSo huge and ubiquitous has been the emergence of open APIs that many experts\\r\\nhave been using the term API economy to refer to the transactions taking place\\r\\nwith the help of APIs. More and more organizations have been realizing the\\r\\npotential of open APIs in transforming their business and have been rolling out\\r\\nopen APIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact of API economy on big data and analytics\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, the impact of the open API economy on big data and analytics has been\\r\\nfelt in the following four areas:\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in the data volume\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of data has grown even more with the growth of open APIs. Let us\\r\\nunderstand how open APIs have contributed to the growth of big data with the\\r\\nexample of the online education domain. Online education is highly popular now,\\r\\nstudents use apps, websites to learn. Now, the educational content is stored in\\r\\ndifferent storage systems and it is a tedious and difficult task to connect so\\r\\nmany storage systems with the apps and also maintain them. In such a case, open\\r\\nAPIs can really help. Open APIs can help apps and websites interact with\\r\\ndifferent data storage systems. Now, when a student uses an app to access say,\\r\\ninteractive lessons on Java, an open API takes the request to the database which\\r\\nsends the required data through the API after proper authorization, if\\r\\napplicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen APIs make it easy to connect to multiple data sources through apps. To\\r\\naccess a data source, all that is needed is to just call an API which delivers\\r\\nthe requested information. More and more people are using open APIs because of\\r\\nthe convenience it provides. Over time, the data volume has grown because more\\r\\ndata is being generated for example student details, course details, student\\r\\nperformance and analysis and patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nCognitive APIs\\r\\n\\r\\nCognitive API is a relatively new development in the world of APIs and it is\\r\\nespecially applicable for analytics. A cognitive API accepts a request in a\\r\\ncertain format from a system and delivers it to another system. Now, the\\r\\nrecipient system provides analytics as response which is delivered to the\\r\\nrequesting system. Cognitive APIs are capable of processing complex,\\r\\nunstructured data and delivering analytics. Many organizations use such APIs to\\r\\ncreate their own products and services.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaster access to big data\\r\\n\\r\\nAPIs can provide big data applications faster access to the data storage. This\\r\\nresults in faster retrieval, processing and analytics. Such APIs can sit as a\\r\\nlayer between distributed computing applications and storage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAPIs now available to the layman\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a time when APIs were the exclusive territory of the developers.\\r\\nDevelopers still know APIs in and out but the layman have also been using APIs,\\r\\nalbeit indirectly. People have been using apps which connect to the APIs. The\\r\\nAPIs take requests and delivers responses from the server which the user views.\\r\\nThis factor has significantly accounted for the huge growth of big data.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant Statistics\\r\\n\\r\\nThe statistics below establishes that the API economy has been getting stronger\\r\\nand influencing big data and analytics.\\r\\n\\r\\n * There is a difference between the growth prediction and actual growth of\\r\\n   public APIs, as per the ProgrammableWeb directory of APIs. This is shown by\\r\\n   the image below.\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: nordicapis.com/tracking-the-growth-of-the-api-economy/\\r\\n\\r\\n * However, the above estimate may be deceptive because there are other API\\r\\n   directories too. Also, the impact of APIs is best gauged when they are\\r\\n   consumed by third-party APIs. Now, such instances are not recorded often but\\r\\n   that does not diminish the importance of the APIs.\\r\\n * The image below shows that the number of API calls has increased\\r\\n   significantly over the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: blog.mailchimp.com/10m-api-calls-per-day-more/\\r\\n\\r\\n * As per Netflix, the number of requests the Netflix API has received over the\\r\\n   years has exponentially increased. From less than 1 billion requests in\\r\\n   January, 2010, the number of requests has increased to more than 20 billion\\r\\n   requests in January, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/02/redesigning-netflix-api.html\\r\\n\\r\\n * A significant development has been the APIs becoming more inclusive. There\\r\\n   was a time when only developers could understand APIs. Now, APIs can be used\\r\\n   even by non-development people. Laymen are able to access APIs, albeit\\r\\n   without their knowledge, through apps.\\r\\n * Smartphones use countless mobile services that are built on APIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems that open APIs are synonymous with convenience, time savings and\\r\\nefficiency. There are good reasons that businesses consider open APIs an\\r\\nimportant business development tool. With due importance given to other\\r\\ninfluences open APIs have had on big data and analytics, the involvement of\\r\\ngeneral public seems to be the most important driver of big data and analytics\\r\\ngrowth. Considering the present times, the API economy seems to on course for an\\r\\nexplosive growth over the next few years and it will redefine many businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated :\\r\\n\\r\\n * Data Science and Cognitive Computing with HPE Haven OnDemand: The Simple Path\\r\\n   to Reason and Insight\\r\\n * HPE Haven OnDemand and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning: Power Tools for\\r\\n   Developers and Data Scientists\\r\\n * Machine Learning at your fingertips – 60+ free APIs, from HPE Haven OnDemand\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious post Next post\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOST POPULAR LAST 30 DAYS\\r\\nMost viewed 1. 7 Steps to Mastering Machine Learning With Python R vs Python for Data Science: The Winner is ...
